## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt that working without figma can make your life a lot more difficult. I struggled to get the proper sixing for the elements on the page and a font sizing and padding that worked for the page, because the style guide given in the files is not very useful. It is only good for getting your colours. Outside of that, you have to use your eye to estimate sizes and view your progress.
